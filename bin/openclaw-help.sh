=====================================================

INSTANCE LIFECYCLE
------------------

      Options:
        --pull          Pull the latest Docker image before creating
        --port PORT     Use a custom API port (WS port = PORT+1)
        -o, --onboard   Start onboarding wizard immediately after creation
      Example:
        openclaw-new 3
        openclaw-new -o 3                   (create + onboard in one step)
        openclaw-new --pull --port 9000 6

  openclaw-onboard N

      Pull the latest OpenClaw Docker image and recreate instance #N.

  openclaw-delete N

      Serve if it was active for that instance.
