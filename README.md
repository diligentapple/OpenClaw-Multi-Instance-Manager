# OpenClaw Multi-Instance Manager
Easily create, manage, and delete multiple [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) Docker instances on a single machine with deterministic naming, ports, data directories, and convenient shortcut commands for quick container access.

This tool wraps a community OpenClaw Docker image (`ghcr.io/phioranex/openclaw-docker:latest`) to make it easy to run multiple isolated instances on a single VPS.

## Prerequisites

- **Linux** (this tool is Linux-only; on Windows use WSL2, on macOS use a Linux VM)
- Docker Engine (20.10+)
- Docker Compose plugin (`docker compose`) or legacy `docker-compose`
- `curl` (for one-liner install)
Docker will be auto installed in this script (if not present on the machine).

## Install

### Option A: Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/diligentapple/OpenClaw-Multi-Instance-Manager.git
cd OpenClaw-Multi-Instance-Manager
sudo bash install.sh
```

### Option B: One-liner (no git required)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/diligentapple/OpenClaw-Multi-Instance-Manager/main/bootstrap.sh | sudo bash
```

### After installing

The installer adds your user to the `docker` group so you can run commands without `sudo`. For this to take effect, either:

```bash
newgrp docker   # apply in current shell
```

or log out and back in.

## Usage

### Step 1: Create an instance

```bash
openclaw-new N
```

Example: `openclaw-new 3` creates instance #3.

Create and immediately run onboarding:

```bash
openclaw-new -o 3
```

Create a range of instances:

```bash
openclaw-new 2-4
```

To force pulling the latest image before creating:

```bash
openclaw-new --pull N
```

### Presets (skip onboarding)

Presets let you create fully configured instances without running the interactive onboarding wizard. On first use, you'll be prompted for your LLM API key which is cached for future runs.

```bash
# Create a single instance with the default preset
openclaw-new 3 --preset default

# Create multiple instances at once
openclaw-new 2-4 --preset default

# Use the remote preset (LAN binding for Tailscale)
openclaw-new 2-4 --preset remote
```

Built-in presets:

| Preset    | Binding   | Description                        |
|-----------|-----------|------------------------------------|
| `default` | loopback  | Local access only                  |
| `remote`  | lan       | LAN binding for Tailscale access   |

#### Managing presets

```bash
# List available presets
openclaw-preset list

# Show a preset's contents
openclaw-preset show default

# Interactively create a custom preset
openclaw-preset create
```

`openclaw-preset create` prompts for:
- AI provider (OpenRouter, Anthropic, OpenAI) and API key
- Primary model
- Telegram bot integration (optional)
- Tailscale remote access (if Tailscale is installed)

### Onboarding (alternative to presets)

If you didn't use `--preset`, run the interactive onboarding wizard:

```bash
openclaw-onboard N
```

### Step 3: Activate Telegram bot

After onboarding with a Telegram channel, send a message to your bot on Telegram. You will see a pairing request in the container logs:

```
OpenClaw: access not configured.
Your Telegram user id: XXXXXXXXXX
Pairing code: XXXXXX
Ask the bot owner to approve with:
  openclaw pairing approve telegram XXXXXX
```

Approve the pairing from your host machine using the instance shortcut:

```bash
openclaw1 pairing approve telegram XXXXXX
```

Replace `1` with your instance number and `XXXXXX` with the actual pairing code shown in the logs.

### Health check / logs

```bash
openclaw-health N
openclaw-logs N
```

### Run commands inside an instance

When you create an instance, a shortcut `openclawN` is automatically created. Use it to run commands inside the container without needing `docker exec`:

```bash
# Directly run a single command
openclaw1 node --version
openclaw2 cat /app/config.json
openclawN pairing approve telegram XXXXXX

# Open an interactive shell in instance 1
openclaw1
```

The longer form also works:

```bash
openclaw-exec 1 node --version
```

## Health check / logs

```bash
# Health check
curl http://127.0.0.1:N8789/health

# Logs
docker logs -f openclawN-gateway
```

### Update an instance (pull latest image and recreate)
Note: Data is preserved, but may cause compatibility issues -> updating using this method not recommanded

```bash
openclaw-update N
```

### List running instances

```bash
openclaw-list
```

### Help

```bash
openclaw-help
```

Shows a complete reference of all available commands with usage details, options, and examples.

### Delete an instance

```bash
openclaw-delete N
openclaw-delete 2-4    # delete a range
```

You will be prompted to type `DELETE` to confirm.

## Port Scheme

Each instance N gets deterministic ports:

| Instance | API Port  | WS Port   |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| 1        | 18789     | 18790     |
| 2        | 28789     | 28790     |
| 3        | 38789     | 38790     |
| ...      | N8789     | N8790     |

## Directory Layout

| Path              | Purpose                          |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|
| `~/openclawN/`    | Compose file for instance N      |
| `~/.openclawN/`   | Persistent data for instance N   |

## Command Reference

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `openclaw-new N\|N-M [--preset NAME]` | Create instance(s) |
| `openclaw-delete N\|N-M` | Delete instance(s) |
| `openclaw-onboard N` | Run onboarding wizard |
| `openclaw-preset [list\|show\|create]` | Manage config presets |
| `openclaw-update N` | Update instance to latest image |
| `openclaw-exec N [cmd...]` | Run command in container |
| `openclawN [cmd...]` | Shortcut for openclaw-exec |
| `openclaw-remote N` | Enable Tailscale remote access |
| `openclaw-logs N` | Follow container logs |
| `openclaw-health N` | Health check |
| `openclaw-list` | List all instances with ports |
| `openclaw-help` | Full command reference |

Run `openclaw-help` for detailed usage of every command.

## Notes

- 1 instance = 1 container
- Instances don't interfere with each other
- Safe to run many on one VPS
- Creating an instance with a number that already exists is blocked -- you must delete first
- `openclaw-new N` without `--pull` uses the locally cached image if one exists; use `openclaw-new --pull N` to ensure you get the latest version

## Remote Dashboard Access (via Tailscale)

Access your OpenClaw dashboard from any device on your Tailscale network with automatic HTTPS.

### Prerequisites

- [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/download/linux) installed and connected (`sudo tailscale up`)
- MagicDNS enabled in [Tailscale admin console](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/dns) (recommended for HTTPS)
- `jq` (auto-installed if missing)

### Enable remote access

```bash
openclaw-remote N
```

This configures the instance for LAN access, sets up allowed origins, configures the host firewall for Tailscale traffic, and starts `tailscale serve` for HTTPS.

### Approve device pairing

When a browser connects for the first time, OpenClaw may require device approval:

```bash
openclaw-remote N --approve       # interactive confirmation
openclaw-remote N --approve --yes # auto-approve without confirmation
```

### Check status

```bash
openclaw-remote N --status
```

Shows config state, Tailscale info, dashboard health, paired/pending devices, and firewall state.

### Disable remote access

```bash
openclaw-remote N --off
```

Reverts config to loopback-only and stops Tailscale Serve. Firewall rules are left in place (harmless).

### Multiple instances

Only one instance can use `https://<hostname>/` via Tailscale Serve at a time. Other instances remain accessible via their direct IP and port (`http://<tailscale-ip>:<port>/`).

### Supported platforms

The firewall auto-configuration handles ufw, firewalld, iptables, and nftables. Cloud-level firewalls (AWS Security Groups, GCP VPC rules, etc.) do not affect Tailscale traffic.

### Troubleshooting

- **"Tailscale is not connected"** -- Run `sudo tailscale up`
- **HTTPS not working** -- Enable MagicDNS at https://login.tailscale.com/admin/dns; certificates may take up to 30 seconds on first use
- **Dashboard rejects connection** -- Check `openclaw-remote N --status` to verify `gateway.bind` is `lan` and origins are set
- **"pairing required"** -- Run `openclaw-remote N --approve`

## Firewall / Reverse Proxy

Ports are bound to `0.0.0.0` by default. For production, consider:

- Binding to `127.0.0.1` and using a reverse proxy (nginx, caddy)
- Configuring firewall rules (`ufw`, `iptables`) to restrict access
